        <p>Daohaus is a social experiment to test pure democratic governance.
          <strong className="underline">The aim is to purchase, manage, and enjoy a single real estate property.</strong></p>
        <p>
          The hope is to use this specific scope to expand and grow the idea into governance of a community, and even a nation. Hopefully
          bringing us closer to a more pure, accountable, and representative government. One that is truly of the people, by
          the people and for the people.
        </p>

        {/* <!-- I shall be asked if I am a prince or a legislature to write on politics. I answer that I am neither, and that is why I do
          so -- Rousseau, Social Contract --> */}

        <p>Three large similarities exist between managing a real estate property, and governing a nation.
          Namely the <strong className="underline">the creation of rules</strong> called laws,&nbsp;
        <strong className="underline">the enforcement of those rules</strong>, and the&nbsp;
        <strong className="underline">the management of an escrow account</strong> that we all fund through our taxes.</p>

        <p>Creating the framework for doing those three things on a much smaller and simpler scale holds an important
          advantage which is flexibility. We start small, so that we can learn from flaws in the design, build it incrementally,
          and test our hypothesis as it grows following an Agile mentality.</p>

        <p>In regards to the larger political dialogue that's occurring in today's society, 
          Daohaus is a proving ground for the advantages of a proposal governance over our 
          current charismatic representative based system that pulls from two major political parties. </p>

        <p> With the maturity of technologies such as the internet and blockchain, this system has&nbsp;
          <strong className="underline">become outdated and unnecessary</strong></p>

        <p>Greed, corruption and incompetence cannot be solved by purely technical solutions, but our hope is that Daohaus will grow
          into a tool used to combat such evils. If you'd like to read more of my thoughts on the subject, please see the afterword
          where I briefly address the implications of this project on our country's&nbsp;
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/daohaus/paper#finances">financial</a>,&nbsp;

        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/daohaus/paper#enforcement">enforcement</a> practices.
        </p>

        <p>In the same way that the Bauhaus movement was characterized by a minimalist type of design, 
          we also hope to <strong className="underline">simplify and minimize governance.</strong></p>
