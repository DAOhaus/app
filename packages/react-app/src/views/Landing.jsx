        <p>An experiment to create governance models & marketplaces to be used for underlying real world assets.&nbsp;
          <strong className="underline">Our initial aim is to purchase, manage, and enjoy a single real estate property in multiple jurisdictions.</strong></p>
        <p>
          The hope is to use this specific scope to expand and grow the idea into governance of a community, and eventually a nation. Hopefully
          bringing us closer to a more pure, accountable, and fluid government of public/private organizations. One that is voluntarily chosen by the people, managed by
          the people and serves at the will of the people.
        </p>

        <p>Three large similarities exist between managing a real estate property, and governing a nation.
        Namely the <strong className="underline">the creation of rules</strong> called laws,&nbsp;
        <strong className="underline">the enforcement of those rules</strong>, and the&nbsp;
        <strong className="underline">the management of an escrow account</strong> that we all fund through fees & estate sales.
        </p>

        <p>Creating the framework for doing those three things on a much smaller and simpler scale holds an important
          advantage which is flexibility. We start small, so that we can learn from flaws in the design, build it incrementally,
          and test our hypothesis as it grows following building patterns such as in the "agile" pattern in software development.</p>

        <p>In regards to the larger political dialogue that's occurring, we hope to be a proving ground for the advantages of a proposal governance over
          charismatic representative based system that pulls from major political parties. </p>

        <p>Our current system has served us well, howevber with the maturity of technologies such as the internet and blockchain, our system has&nbsp;
          <strong className="underline">become outdated and unnecessary</strong></p>

        <p>Greed, corruption and incompetence cannot be solved by purely technical solutions, but our hope is that ‚ñ°‚àÜ‚óãhaus will grow
          into an ecosystem used to combat such evils. If you'd like to read more of my thoughts on the subject, please see the afterword
          where I briefly address the implications of this project on our&nbsp;
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/daohaus/paper#finances">financial</a>,&nbsp;

        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/daohaus/paper#enforcement">enforcement</a> practices.
        </p>

        <p>In the same way that the Bauhaus movement was characterized by a minimalist type of design,
          we also hope to <strong className="underline">simplify and minimize governance.</strong></p>
